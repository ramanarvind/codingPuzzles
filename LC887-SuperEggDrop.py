LC887: Super Egg Drop
URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/super-egg-drop/
You are given K eggs, and you have access to a building with N floors from 1 to 
N. 

Each egg is identical in function, and if an egg breaks, you cannot drop it 
again.

You know that there exists a floor F with 0 <= F <= N such that any egg dropped 
at a floor higher than F will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor F 
will not break.

Each move, you may take an egg (if you have an unbroken one) and drop it from 
any floor X (with 1 <= X <= N). 

Your goal is to know with certainty what the value of F is.

What is the minimum number of moves that you need to know with certainty what F 
is, regardless of the initial value of F?

 

Example 1:

Input: K = 1, N = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Drop the egg from floor 1.  If it breaks, we know with certainty that F = 0.
Otherwise, drop the egg from floor 2.  If it breaks, we know with certainty that F = 1.
If it didn't break, then we know with certainty F = 2.
Hence, we needed 2 moves in the worst case to know what F is with certainty.

Example 2:
Input: K = 2, N = 6
Output: 3

Example 3:
Input: K = 3, N = 14
Output: 4
 

Note:

1 <= K <= 100
1 <= N <= 10000
